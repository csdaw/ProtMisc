## PSMs.txt

- Need to output table with the link tables option ticked
- Each PSM has a unique ID in the `PSMs.Peptide.ID` column
- If you have 2 separate PSMs files and just rbind them, then there would be
doubling up of `PSMs.Peptide.ID`s. A workaround for this is to paste together
the `PSMs.Peptide.ID` and `Spectrum.File` columns.
- Use the `PSMs.Peptide.ID` column to join with the `PeptideGroups_PSMs` linking
table.

## peptideGroups.txt

- Each peptide has a unique ID in the `Peptide.Groups.Peptide.Group.ID` column
- These can be 

- If you have 2 separate PeptideGroups files and just rbind them, then there 
would be doubling up of `Peptide.Groups.Peptide.Group.ID`s. A workaround for 
this is to... paste together sequence and modifications? Or use Tom's function
to find a common master proteins.
